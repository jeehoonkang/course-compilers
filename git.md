# Git

[Git](http://git-scm.com) is a [version control
system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control): it helps you
to effectively manage your source code.  With git you can do:

- Dividing works into small pieces: Git helps you to divide works into
  smaller and logically cohesive units.  Generally it is good for your
  productivity: you can focus on one thing at a time.

- Versioning your project: you can track the history of your project,
  and have multiple versions of it (e.g., `master`, `feature-A`,
  `bugfix`, ...), and merge those versions later.

- Collaborating with others without pain: with multiple versions it is
  much easier to share and cowork on your project.

In this course your are *required* to maintain your homework with Git:
you have to submit your Git repository.  It is not evaluated whether
you use Git well or not, but I am confident that you can be more
productive if Git is properly used.
