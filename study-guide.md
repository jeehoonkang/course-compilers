## Notes & Attendance (10%)

You are expected to read all the notes in this repository.  Notes are
not so long, so it will not be burdensome to read them.  They are also
terse, so it is strongly recommended to attend the class.


## Homework (60%)

- See [Homework](homework.md).


## Exam (30%)

In the exam you are asked to answer questions related to the principle
and the practice of compiler construction.

You *will be asked* to answer questions like:

- Is the following string accepted by the following grammar?  Why?

    `((()())())`

    `S ::= S S | (S) | ()`

- What is the benefit of intermediate languages in compiler
  construction?

- Explain the following compiler optimizations:

    + Common Subexpression Elimination
    + Constant Propagation
    + Dead Code Elimination

- What is SSA?  Why it is useful?

- What is the outcome of the following ARM program?

    `...` (some ARM program)

- Compile (by your hand) the following C program to ARM.

    `...` (some C program)


However, you *will not be asked* to answer questions like:

- What is the typical organization of compilers?

- What is the pros and cons of high-level programming languages?

- Name any parser generator.

- Name three compiler optimizations.

- What does "SSA" stands for?
