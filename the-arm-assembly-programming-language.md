# The ARM Assembly Programming Language

The ARM assembly programming language is the target of the compiler we
will construct in this course.  ARM assembly is a low-level
programming language (*i.e.*, it focus on supporting the machine to
easily understand and efficiently execute programs).  Thus the
structure and the interpretation of the language is vastly different
from those of high-level languages.

The following code is an example ARM assembly program:

```arm
